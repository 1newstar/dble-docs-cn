## 1.The Subquery as Scalar Operand
For example :  

    SELECT (SELECT s2 FROM t1);  
    SELECT (SELECT s1 FROM t2) FROM t1;  
    SELECT UPPER((SELECT s1 FROM t1)) FROM t2;  

 

## 2.Comparisons Using Subqueries
The most common use of a subquery is in the form:

	non_subquery_operand comparison_operator (subquery)

Where comparison_operator is one of these operators:

	=    >    <    >=    <=    <>    !=    <=>

MySQL also permits this construct:

	non_subquery_operand LIKE (subquery)

## 3 Subqueries with ANY, IN, or SOME
Syntax:

	operand comparison_operator ANY (subquery)
	operand IN (subquery)
	operand comparison_operator SOME (subquery)

 

Where comparison_operator is one of these operators:

	=    >    <    >=    <=    <>    !=

## 4 Subqueries with ALL
Syntax:

	operand comparison_operator ALL (subquery)

## 5. Subqueries with EXISTS or NOT EXISTS
For example:

	SELECT column1 FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM t2);

Not support Correlated Subqueries for now.

 

## 6.Derived Tables (Subqueries in the FROM Clause)

	SELECT ... FROM (subquery) [AS] tbl_name ...
